    "\n",
    "- This assignment requires running on GPU-enabled hardware. We highly recommand you to run all debuging in your enviroment and the training itself in google colab. Use the `checkpoint` to download the trained model back to your computer for inference and submission.\n",
    "- The text and code cells in these notebooks are intended to guide you through the\n",
    "  assignment and help you verify your solutions.\n",
    "  The notebooks **do not need to be edited** at all (unless you wish to play around).\n",
    "  The only exception is to fill your name(s) in the above cell before submission.\n",
    "  Please do not remove sections or change the order of any cells, **your grade will decresse drusticly if you do**.\n",
    "- All your code (and even answers to questions) should be written in the files\n",
    "  within the python package corresponding the assignment number (`hw1`, `hw2`, etc).\n",
    "  You can of course use any editor or IDE to work on these files.\n",
    "- The project code should be submmited in `project` dir, and the training process (the logs), the graphs and all the explanation should be in the corispond **notebook**. try to implement it close to the HW assigments, as the model implementation, losses etc.. all in .py files, while the things you want to present is in the notebook.\n",
