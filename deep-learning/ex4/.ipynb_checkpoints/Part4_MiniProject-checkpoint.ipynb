    "- Explain the structure of your code and how to run it to reproduce your results.\n",

    "- Before submitting, make sure all files which are required to run this notebook are included in the generated submission zip.\n",
    "- Try to keep the submission file size under 10MB. Do not include model checkpoint files, dataset files, or any other non-essentials files. Instead include your results as images/text files/pickles/etc, and load them for display in this notebook. "

    "One of the prevailing approaches for improving training stability for GANs is to use a technique called [Spectral Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05957.pdf) to normalize the largest singular value of a weight matrix so that it equals 1.\n",
    "This approach is generally applied to the discriminator's weights in order to stabilize training. The resulting model is sometimes referred to as a SN-GAN.\n",
    "See Appendix A in the linked paper for the exact algorithm. You can also use pytorch's `spectral_norm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very common improvement to the vanilla GAN is known a [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) (WGAN). It uses a simple modification to the loss function, with strong theoretical justifications based on the Wasserstein (earth-mover's) distance.\n",
    "See the tutorial or [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/loss) for a brief explanation of this loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with generative models for images is that it's difficult to objectively assess the quality of the resulting images.\n",
    "To also obtain a quantitative score for the images generated by each model,\n",
    "we'll use the [Inception Score](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf).\n",
    "This uses a pre-trained Inception CNN model on the generated images and computes a score based on the predicted probability for each class.\n",
    "Although not a perfect proxy for subjective quality, it's commonly used a way to compare generative models.\n",
    "You can use an implementation of this score that you find online, e.g. [this one](https://github.com/sbarratt/inception-score-pytorch) or implement it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would gain a **Bonus** if you also adress [Gradient Penalty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf), as we saw in the tutorial that it could improve the robustness of the GAN and essentially improve the results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the linked papers, add Spectral Normalization and the Wassertein loss to your GAN from HW3.\n",
    "Compare between:\n",
    "- The baseline model (vanilla GAN)\n",
    "- SN-GAN (vanilla + Spectral Normalization)\n",
    "- WGAN (using Wasserstein Loss)\n",
    "- Optional: SN+WGAN, i.e. a combined model using both modifications.\n",
    "- Bonus: WGAN+GP and SN+WGAN+GP\n",
    "\n",
    "As a dataset, you can use [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) as in HW3 or [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), or even choose a custom dataset (note that there's a dataloder for CelebA in `torchvision`). \n",

    "  - Inception score (can use a subset of the data).\n",
